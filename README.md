- **Channel selection** - choose where to send facts
- **Auto mode** - automatically send facts on a timer (guild/group only)
- **Saved settings** - your channel preference and fact history persist between sessions
- **Keybind support** - bind a key to share facts (Settings > Keybindings > ESO Facts)
- **Statistics** - track how many facts you've shared
- **Settings menu** - configure options via LibAddonMenu (optional)
- **Custom facts** - add your own facts to the rotation

## Commands

| Command | Description |

### Channel Options

- `say` - Local /say chat (default)
- `yell` - /yell chat
- `zone` - Zone chat
- `group` or `party` - Group/party chat
- `guild1` through `guild5` - Guild chats

## Keybind

You can bind a key to share facts instead of typing `/facts`:

1. Open Settings > Keybindings
2. Scroll to "ESO Facts"
3. Set your preferred key for "Share Random Fact"

## Settings Menu

If you have [LibAddonMenu](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info7-LibAddonMenu.html) installed, you can configure ESOFacts through the game's addon settings:

- **Cooldown** - Adjust the cooldown between facts (0-30 seconds)
- **Default Channel** - Set your preferred chat channel
- **Auto Mode Settings** - Configure minimum interval and max facts
- **Reset Cycle** - Clear shown facts to see them all again

Access via: Settings > Addon Settings > ESO Facts (or type `/factsettings`)

## Auto Mode

Automatically sends facts to chat at a set interval. Includes safeguards to prevent spam:

- **Minimum interval**: 5 minutes (configurable in settings)
- **Maximum facts**: 10 (configurable in settings, then auto-stops)
- **Restricted channels**: Only works with group and guild chat (not say, yell, or zone)

### Example Usage

```
/factschannel guild1
/factsauto 10
```

This sends a random fact to guild 1 every 10 minutes, stopping after 10 facts.

## Custom Facts

Add your own facts to the rotation:

```
/factsadd The Ebonheart Pact was formed after the Akaviri invasion.
/factslist
/factsremove 1
```

Custom facts are saved between sessions and included in the random rotation alongside built-in facts.

## Installation

1. Download and extract to your AddOns folder:
   - Windows: `Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\AddOns\ESOFacts`
2. Enable the addon in the game's addon menu
3. Type `/facts` in chat to get started
